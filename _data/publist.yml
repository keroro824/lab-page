  image: TriForce.png
  description: With large language models (LLMs) deployed for long content generation, the growing key-value (KV) cache size has become a bottleneck, leading to low computational core utilization and high latency. TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system, addresses this by using dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval and a smaller model for speculative decoding, achieving up to 2.31× speedup on an A100 GPU and notable efficiency on RTX 4090 GPUs. TriForce also outperforms DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference by 4.86× on a single RTX 4090 GPU, maintaining robust performance across various temperatures.

  description: Sequoia offers a scalable, robust, and hardware-aware solution for speculative decoding. Sequoia uses a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal token tree structures, a novel sampling and verification method for robust performance across temperatures, and a hardware-aware optimizer for maximum efficiency. Evaluations show Sequoia significantly speeds up decoding, improving Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B performance on an A100 by up to 4.04×, 3.73×, and 2.27×, respectively, and achieving impressive speedups in offloading settings.
